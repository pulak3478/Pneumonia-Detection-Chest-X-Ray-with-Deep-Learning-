# Pneumonia-Detection-Chest-X-Ray-with-Deep-Learning-
This project presents a deep learning-based approach to automate pneumonia detection using chest X-ray (CXR) images. Traditionally, CXR interpretation requires expertise, leading to potential delays and variability in diagnosis. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to streamline the detection process, reducing relianc\
